# Prayers
I used Java and SpringMVC to create a praying circle where details like who is participating and what is the reason for prayer are noted. 

How to open it:

1. You need Apache and MySQL from XAMPP
2. Import prayers.sql to http://localhost/phpmyadmin/
3. Tomcat 9.0 installed in Eclipse
4. Run as server on tomcat in Eclipse
